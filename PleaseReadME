First of all, thank you guys for participating in an interesting task.

I need to leave some comments related to this task. I have made this project as flexible as possible, so you can run all travel projects in one command. 

All Page Objects are divided into components because in the past I had problems with maintenance pages with above 1000 lines of code. It is hard to read.

Putting locators in Elements objects gives you some opportunities to modify text inside locators. Especially it is helpful with changing locators e.g. containing dates.

I set a linter, so it is really helpful to maintain better code formatting.

If we talk about tests. I use soft assertions because it do not end the test after the first fail.
It is really difficult to test pages with dynamic content and which we do not have control on it. So a better way would be just to inject some data using API.
Problems with page content were e.g. changing prices of travel, changing offers list or even in some cases. So some tests would fail.

If it is possible, please write me a complex review, because it is for me very important to write better code and tests.

All the best!!
